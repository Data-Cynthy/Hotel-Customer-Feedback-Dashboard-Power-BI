# Hotel-Customer-Feedback-Dashboard-Power-BI
A data storytelling project showing insights from hotel customer feedback data.

## Project Overview
This project is a fully interactive Customer Feedback Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI. It showcases how customer experience (CX), business insights, and data storytelling come together to support decision-making in the hospitality industry.
The dashboard analyzes 2+ years of customer feedback data from Skyline Towers, focusing on satisfaction scores, NPS performance, visitor demographics, and marketing effectiveness.
It is designed to help leadership identify customer pain points, understand guest behavior, and optimize areas that directly impact revenue and service delivery.

This project reflects my ability to:
- Clean and model data  
- Build intuitive, executive-ready dashboards  
- Translate complex data into actionable insights  
- Apply customer experience (CX) concepts in analytics  
- Present insights in a structured, business-focused way  

## Objectives of the Dashboard

The dashboard answers key business questions such as:
- What is our overall customer satisfaction rating?  
- How are customers scoring different service areas (staff, restaurant, rooms, facility)?  
- What is our Net Promoter Score (NPS) and how are promoters, passives, and detractors distributed?  
- What brings visitors to the hotel: business, vacation, events?  
- What are the most effective sources of customer acquisition?  
- How do these metrics trend across time (2020–2022)?

## Recommendations (Business & CX Focused)
